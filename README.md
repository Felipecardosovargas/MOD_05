# Module 5: Data Persistence with Java and JDBC

This project is part of the full stack training program from **3035tech**, designed to provide hands-on, market-relevant experience. In Module 5, I'm enhancing my skills in **data persistence using Java and JDBC**. The main focus is on studying and applying:

- **Complex transaction management (ACID)** to ensure data integrity.  
- Use of **Stored Procedures with `CallableStatement`** to centralize and optimize business logic at the database level.  
- Implementation of **connection pooling** to improve performance and scalability in professional Java applications.

The goal is to build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications that interact efficiently with database management systems.

In addition to technical skills in data persistence, this module emphasizes **strategic communication, teamwork, and code documentation**. By collaborating on solution development, documenting design decisions, and presenting results, we simulate a real professional development environmentâ€”crucial for full stack training.

This repository demonstrates not only my proficiency with Java, JDBC, and advanced persistence concepts but also my readiness to contribute to high-quality, collaborative software projects as a full stack developer in training.

## Key Topics Covered

- **JDBC API**: Fundamentals of Java Database Connectivity for interacting with relational databases.
- **Connections and Statements**: Managing connections (`Connection`) and executing SQL commands using `Statement` and `PreparedStatement`.
- **Result Handling**: Processing query results using `ResultSet`.
- **Transaction Management (ACID)**: Explicit transaction control (commit, rollback) to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
- **Stored Procedures & `CallableStatement`**: Executing stored procedures in the database.
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management techniques for performance and resource optimization.
- **Batch Processing**: Executing multiple SQL operations in batches to improve performance.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (Intro/DAO)**: Introduction to patterns like Data Access Object (DAO) to abstract and organize data access logic (if applicable to the module).

## Focus on Strategic Communication

- **Team Collaboration**: Working in groups to develop solutions and practice clear, effective communication.
- **Technical Documentation**: Writing documentation to explain design logic, architecture decisions, and implementation details.
- **Technical Presentations**: Presenting project outcomes, encountered challenges, and implemented solutions to improve professional communication.
